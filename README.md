# TRACEHOUND

**Deterministic Runtime Security Buffer for Modern Applications.**

Tracehound Core is a deterministic and fail-open runtime security layer designed to operate between detection systems and operational response.
It provides bounded ingestion, rate and buffer controls, controlled choke mechanisms, and reproducible event processing.
The system does not classify threats or enforce policies. Instead, it guarantees controlled runtime behavior and integrity of the resulting event chain.
